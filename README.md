The output of this exercise is broken up into two parts within a mock PowerPoint presentation. Slides 1-16 illustrate where we could present one to three solution options at various price points and discuss the value proposition for each one, and where each option would have the most impact on the organization.  Slides 17-21 serve to address the questions that couldn't easily be represented in the client portion of the deck, but ideally would be covered either in the verbal portion of the presentation or in the SOW or communicated in our initial designs and discussed with the technical stakeholders prior to deployment.  For example, you wouldn't make a technology decision on tooling without first discussing what they are utilizing today and how that would impact them and their governance and ability to ramp up or go hire for.   The presentation also took a cloud-agnostic approach because we don't know which CSP would be the better choice or which one they would prefer.   At the pre-sales level, since we know this client is greenfield, we could be leveraging our partner relationships with the CSPs to try and secure discounts and funding for our work.  Guiding the client on this decision is important to how we will staff and engage in the delivery.

The discussion around containerization wasn't highlighted much in either section of the proposal.  This was deliberate, as there is a time and place to address technical decisions and to educate the client.  I believe it is very unlikely that we will be building Kubernetes clusters in IaaS, especially when there are so many better PaaS solutions to choose from. However, if the client is still unsure on whether they should adopt containers or not and we don't have a target CSP identified, a higher level conversation could be had at the pre-sales level on the benefits:
